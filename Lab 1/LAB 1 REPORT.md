## Theory
 Cryptography consists a part of the science known as Cryptology. The other part is Cryptanalysis. There are a lot of different algorithms/mechanisms used in Cryptography.
 Some of them, which are implemented in this laboratory work are:
- Caesar cipher with one key used for substitution (as explained above);
- Caesar cipher with one key used for substitution, and a permutation of the alphabet;
- Vigenere cipher;
- Playfair cipher.
These are classical ciphers. In contrast to modern cryptographic algorithms, most classical ciphers can be practically computed and solved by hand. However, they are also usually very simple to break with modern technology.


## Objectives:

* Get familiar with the basics of cryptography and classical ciphers.
* Implement 4 types of the classical ciphers:

- Caesar cipher with one key used for substitution (as explained above),
- Caesar cipher with one key used for substitution, and a permutation of the alphabet,
- Vigenere cipher,
- Playfair cipher.


## Implementation description

* About 2-3 sentences to explain each piece of the implementation.


* Code snippets from your files.

```
public static void main() 
{

}
```
